# Coding warmup 3/11/24

For today's warmup we work in React

- Clone down the repo
- CD into the repo
- npm install
- open the repo in VSCode
- write your code

Customize the navbar component, and do a fetch for the Oscars winners and map them on your page.
If time allows you could add cards, and some logic to show the name of the film only when it doesn't match the value in the winner key of your data.

Get familiar with your data [here](https://oscars-2024-winners-backend.onrender.com/winners)

This the API link: https://oscars-2024-winners-backend.onrender.com/winners

The render service may go dormant, so allow it to start.

Good luck and have fun!
